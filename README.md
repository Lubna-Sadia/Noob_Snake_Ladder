# Noob_Snake_Ladder
This is my first basic code for a game

It's a console controlled version of the classic snake ladder  game for upto four players. Enter the number of fellow players and get started. Roll the dice and keep going higher. The terrible snakes being your nemesis can pull you down. Or you might get booned with a ladder to get closer to winning. So, go on and enjoy the thrill!
